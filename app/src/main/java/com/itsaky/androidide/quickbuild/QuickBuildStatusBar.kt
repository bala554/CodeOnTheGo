 * the same way: compiling, landed, BUILD FAILED. Resource ids rather than strings so the mapping
 * stays a pure JVM function (testable without a Context) while the surface stays translatable -
 * unlike [quickBuildOutputLines], whose Build Output copy is deliberately untranslated log text.

 * line. That is what an activity recreation needs. But the status collector re-runs on every
 * onStart and the status is a replaying StateFlow, so a tracker scoped to the collector makes
 * every return to the editor look like a new bar: Quick Build fails to start, a standard run
 * then writes its own result line, and backgrounding CoGo and returning re-stomps that line with
 * "could not start". Holding the tracker on the activity keeps a first emission meaning a new
 * bar, which is the distinction the sticky states are gated on.
