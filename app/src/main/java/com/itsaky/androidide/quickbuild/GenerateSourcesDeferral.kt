/**
 * Defers the resource-save `generateSources()` Gradle build while a Quick Build session is live
 * (ADFA-4128, quickbuild/docs/resource-updates.md "Defer the build while a Quick Build session
 * is live").
 *
 * The Gradle build exists to keep the Java language server's R symbols fresh: a successful
 * `generateSources` regenerates the intermediates R.jar and posts the `ProjectInitializedEvent`
 * that makes the Java LSP re-read it. Quick Build's reload pipeline never consumes that output -
 * the proxy app gets its resources from Quick Build's own aapt2 relink - so deferring the build
 * costs nothing but a few seconds of editor symbol freshness, and removes the CPU contention
 * between Gradle and the reload plus the single-Gradle-slot contention with the user's own
 * builds.
 *
 * A save-time "is Quick Build building?" check cannot work: at save time the Quick Build
 * pipeline has not started yet (the watcher batch is still inside its 150 ms debounce), so
 * sampling status at that moment misses the primary case. Instead the request keys on session
 * state: with no session it runs immediately (today's behavior); while a session is live it
 * parks, coalescing any number of saves into one pending request, and the one build runs when
 * the pipeline settles - an active-but-idle state held for [idleGraceMillis], long enough to
 * outlast the watcher's debounce and its 2 s mtime-poll fallback so the build does not launch
 * right under an incoming reload. A session that ends with a request still parked runs it
 * rather than dropping it.
 *
 * Releasing a request is not the same as running one. [ProjectManagerImpl.generateSources]
 * early-returns silently when a Gradle build is already in progress, and the session state this
 * class keys off cannot see that: a project sync or the user's own Run occupies the same single
 * Gradle slot while the session sits in a state this class reads as settled. So a release keys
 * off what the build request reports, and re-parks the request when it reports that nothing
 * started.
 *
 * @property scope where the state collection, the grace timers and every deferred build run.
 * @property runBuild the actual build request; asynchronous in production
 *   ([ProjectManagerImpl.generateSources] hands the tasks to the tooling server and returns).
 *   Reports whether the tasks were dispatched - false means the request was refused and still
 *   owes a retry.
 * @property idleGraceMillis how long an active session must sit outside its busy states before
 *   a parked request is released, and how long a refused request waits before trying again.
