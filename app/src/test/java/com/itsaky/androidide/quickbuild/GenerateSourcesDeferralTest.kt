/**
 * The deferral contract (quickbuild/docs/resource-updates.md): a resource save runs
 * `generateSources` immediately when no Quick Build session exists, parks it while one is live,
 * coalesces N saves into one request, and releases exactly one build when the pipeline settles
 * or the session ends - never dropping a parked request.
 *
 * "Released" is not "ran": `generateSources` refuses silently while any Gradle build is in
 * progress, including builds this class cannot see from session state. [attempts] counts every
 * call, [builds] only the ones that dispatched, and the gap between them is what the retry
 * behaviour is about.
