/**
 * The end-to-end live-reload loop for one generation: the user-perceived save->live time
 * ([totalMs]) and a per-stage split that adds up to it (ADFA-4128 e2e-timing). Keyed by
 * (qbSessionId, generation) - the same generation the completed event reports - so the
 * timing joins to route/outcome without carrying either here. All stamps are device-local
 * `elapsedRealtime` deltas; everything else is a counter. No paths, file names, or source
 * content leave the device.
 *
 * The spans have to cover the whole loop, not just compilation: source scan, Java-ABI
 * snapshot, the two output-tree walks and the deploy-policy class-header pass are where the
 * dominant cost lives (per-file I/O on FUSE-backed emulated storage), while javac is only
 * 19-27% of a warm edit. [unaccountedMs] keeps the split honest - it is whatever no span
 * measured, so an un-timed step shows up as a visible number instead of quietly inflating
 * its neighbour. [queueMs] is broken out of that residual for the same reason: it is a save
 * waiting behind another build, not build work, and must not be read as build cost.
 *
 * Bundle size is deliberate. Firebase caps a custom event at [MAX_EVENT_PARAMS]
 * parameters, and [com.itsaky.androidide.analytics.AnalyticsManager.trackMetric] adds a
 * `timestamp` on top of these, so the worst-case route must stay under that cap - a test
 * enforces it, and with [queueMs] there is no headroom left: another field means dropping
 * one. The finer daemon-internal timings (the aapt2 pair, the two walks separately) live in
 * the bench `reload_timeline` event, which has no such limit; here they are summed or
 * omitted.
