/**
 * Tracks whether an INTERNAL build is running - one the user never asked for that goes through the
 * same Gradle path as a Standard Run (today, Quick Build's proxy app build).
 *
 * An acquire that is never released is silent and permanent: the editor's build listener stays
 * suppressed (see [suppressWhileHeld]) so nothing ever clears "a build is running", and the toolbar
 * keeps the Cancel-build label until the process restarts. That is why [hold] is the only way in -
 * a caller cannot put a statement between the acquire and the try.
 *
 * @param onFirstAcquire runs on the OUTERMOST acquire only.
 * @param onHeldChanged runs with true on the outermost acquire and false on the matching release,
 *   so an observer can show a build the user did not start as "a build is running".
